<p>
I’m a passionate Software Developer with more than 6 years experience and a keen attention for software development enterprise patterns and methodologies, web technologies and architectures. 
</p>
<p>
Starting as junior frontend developer and later moving more towards backend development, in my career I’ve been building my expertise in both the development and operational aspects.
I’ve been working as a part of team of about 10 people working in bigger cross teams projects and environments as well as an individual freelance developer.
</p>
<p>
I love dealing with highly scalable and fast architectures, network applications, and apis.
I love clean and self commenting code with a big respect to all modern standards and techniques, I have the passion for learning and improving skills, I'm the big fan of OOP and Functional programming and accept any task as a challenge to make the best I can.
