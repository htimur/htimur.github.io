<p>
I am a technical, goal and success oriented, data-driven generalist and problem solver. I love building simple, but efficient solutions at organization, teams, infrastructure and code base-level.
</p>
<p>
I use my experience in the software/infrastructure architecture and software engineering to ship bulletproof, decentralized systems with isolated components.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy working and coaching developers and teams, help them understand how they fit into the company value chain. I believe that people come because of the tech stack, and stay because they feel that they are doing something valuable.
</p>
<p>
After all the main success driver is the happiness and the feeling of successful accomplishment of the goals.
